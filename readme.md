# A simpel proxy

This is an Node/Express based simple proxy. It will take a query for `term` and do a request to `https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=` and respond with the response from Apple, if the requester is from CodePen or localhost.
It has been created as part of a blog post on dev.to: Small API based web app in 3 minutes.
